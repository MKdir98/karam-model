# Introduction

In an era where human-computer interaction (HCI) is increasingly integral to daily life, understanding and enhancing user experience (UX) is paramount. The ability to accurately capture and interpret user interactions with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) holds immense potential for improving usability, productivity, and accessibility across a wide range of applications. With this in mind, our proposed project seeks to create a comprehensive dataset of user interactions and develop an advanced predictive model for GUI actions.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize the way we understand and interact with digital interfaces. By capturing real-time user events such as typing, clicking, right-clicking, and scrolling, along with corresponding screenshots, we aim to build a rich repository of data that reflects the nuanced behaviors and preferences of users. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and practitioners in fields such as HCI, machine learning, and AI.

Furthermore, our project aims to go beyond mere data collection by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for GUI actions. By analyzing the contextual information provided by screenshots and user tasks, our model will be capable of accurately predicting the next user action, whether it be typing a specific text input, clicking on a particular UI element, or executing a complex sequence of interactions.

Ultimately, the outcomes of this project have the potential to drive innovation in GUI design, usability testing, automation, and accessibility. By gaining deeper insights into user behavior and preferences, we can develop more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that cater to the diverse needs of individuals across different contexts and abilities. Through this proposal, we seek funding support to realize the full potential of our project and make meaningful contributions to the field of human-computer interaction.

Data collection will be conducted over an extended period during which the user will interact with various applications and interfaces, providing a diverse range of user behaviors and scenarios.

### 2- Data Preprocessing

The captured data will undergo extensive preprocessing to prepare it for model training. This includes organizing the raw event data into structured formats, cleaning and filtering out irrelevant events, and aligning the screenshots with their corresponding events. Additionally, we will extract relevant features from the screenshots, such as visual elements and contextual information, to augment the input data for the predictive model.

### 3- Model Development

We will employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to develop the predictive model for GUI actions. This will involve designing and training deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze the sequential nature of user interactions and extract meaningful patterns from the input data. The model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset, with a focus on optimizing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 4- Model Evaluation

Once the model is trained, we will evaluate its performance using rigorous testing procedures. This will involve splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, with cross-validation to ensure robustness. We will assess the model's predictive accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability across different computing environments and user tasks. Additionally, we will compare the model's performance against baseline methods and human performance benchmarks to validate its effectiveness.

### 5- Model Deployment

Upon successful validation, we will deploy the predictive model in real-world applications to demonstrate its practical utility. This may involve integrating the model into existing software systems or developing standalone applications for usability testing, automation, or accessibility enhancement. We will solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to iteratively improve the model's performance and usability over time.
